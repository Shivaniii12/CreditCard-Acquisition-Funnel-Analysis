# 💳 Credit Card Customer Acquisition Funnel Analysis

> Identifying high-value customer segments and optimizing 
> campaign ROI using SQL, Python & Machine Learning

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a commercial card acquisition funnel 
across 41,188 customers to identify high-converting segments, 
optimize campaign outreach strategy, and build a propensity 
model for lead prioritization.

**Domain:** Financial Services | Customer Acquisition Analytics  
**Tools:** Python, SQL, XGBoost, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  
**Dataset:** UCI Bank Marketing Dataset (41,188 records)

## 📊 Key Findings

### 1️⃣ Segment Analysis
- Student & Retired segments convert at **31-36%** — 3x above baseline
- Blue-collar consumes **22.47% of outreach** but delivers only **13.75%** of conversions
- Single students are the highest value profile converting at **27-37%**

### 2️⃣ Channel Performance
- Cellular converts at **14.74%** vs Telephone **5.23%** — 3x difference
- 9 out of 10 top channel-job combinations use Cellular

### 3️⃣ Campaign Timing
- March & December achieve **50%+ conversion** with only 1-2% of budget
- May wastes **33% of budget** at only **6.43%** conversion rate

### 4️⃣ Call Duration Impact
- Calls under 100s convert at **0.79%**
- Calls over 600s convert at **48.61%** — 60x difference!

### 5️⃣ A/B Test Simulation
- Random outreach: **261 conversions** (10.56%)
- Model guided: **913 conversions** (36.95%)
- Same budget. Same effort. **3.5x better results!**
